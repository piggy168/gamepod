After beginning Bikram Yoga in 2005 his life took a complete 180 degree angle turn - a new body, new mind, and new life. Within the first year of practice he shed pounds, threw away medications, and became a fixture in the Dallas studio.
This amazing physical transformation inspired him to try his first yoga competition in Texas in 2005. After years of dedication he won the 2009 National USA Yoga Asana Championship and placed 2nd internationally. He then went on to win again in 2010, and in 2011 he won both the national and international championships.
Because of the gift of life yoga has given him, his life’s ambition is to share competitive Yoga with others. Joseph teaches full time and enjoys travel, philosophy, and playing classical guitar.",

When playing with The River, players begin the game by placing the river tiles. The first tile placed is the spring, where the river begins. Then each player takes turns adding a river tile by connecting the river for a continuous flow to the last river tile – the lake. Along the way, players can play followers/meeples to the river tiles like normal; in fields, in cities, on roads (just can’t place them on the river itself – there are no swimmer or fisherman followers).",

    description: "he year has just begun but I already think I've found game of the year candidate. While taking a trip to the hobby store for me to purchase the Witcher: Adventure game my girlfriend picked up Alchemists.

Alchemists is released by CGE which is the publisher of another favorite of mind Caroline's favorite game) DungeonLords. The artwork style and colors are similar to that game as well, so are a few other mechanics such as worker placement/resource gathering.

The game has each player take on the role of an alchemist trying to gather the most reputation at the university, outdoing his scholarly colleagues by unlocking the secret alchemical formula that make up the 8 different ingredients in the game and then publish their findings to earn scholarly acknowledgement. Just like Dungeon Lords this game plays 2-4 players, however you don't use AI players to fill up the seats if you play below the maximum number of players. Having played the game some 12 times since we bought it (a week ago!) I can say that it works very well for 2 players.

The game spans 6 turns, and the player with the most reputation points towards the end is the winner. Each turn players place small work cubes on the board in locations where they want to do their actions. The turn order is decided by the players themselves as they place turn order tokens on a track. The further down on the track you place your turn order token the more freebee resources you will receive, however that will at the same time punish you since player higher up on the track will be able to place their work cubes on the board before you.",

The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the normal spread of the infections.
Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!",

    description: "It's been a long time since we've produced an import review - thankfully the dark days of console releases separated by months or even years are now a thing of the past - but Nintendo's new Wii U is out now in the USA, almost two weeks ahead of its European debut, and when the opportunity arose for us to acquire a unit ahead of time along with a clutch of games, we jumped at the chance. With that in mind though, before we go any further we need to stress that this review is based entirely on US hardware, so there may well be differences compared to the console you'll be buying. We'll be sure to clue you in on those variations as soon as we get our hands on the UK model, but at the time of writing we've yet to receive one.

So here we are with an American Wii U, bringing with it the legacy challenges of running  equipment in the 50Hz territories - specifically ensuring that we don't blow it up by connecting up the 110v power supply into 220v mains. A quick trip to Maplin to pick up a 300W step-down transformer was our chosen solution - overkill bearing in mind the power-efficiency of the console, but probably best for covering our bases if we find ourselves facing the same issue with the next-generation Xbox in 12 months' time. With the power supply situation resolved, we were ready to begin. The next generation of console gaming - or rather, Nintendo's vision of it - begins now.

First impressions on opening up the box? There's a fair amount of kit in here. Two slim cardboard boxes compromise the interior of the package, with the console and GamePad in one and accessories in the other.

Nintendo Wii U: the specs:
Much of the internal architecture of the Wii U remains shrouded in secrecy, but gradually a picture is coming together of the machine's capabilities...

Main unit:

CPU: IBM Power Architecture-based multi-core processor
GPU: AMD Radeon GPU with 32MB onboard eDRAM
RAM: 2GB, consisting of four Hynix DDR3-1600 modules
Storage: 8GB and 32GB configurations available
Optical Drive: Panasonic 25GB, with Wii DVD back-compat
Ports: 2x USB, SD card slot, sensor bar output, AV multi-out, HDMI
Video Output: 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p
Gamepad:

Display: 6.2-inch resistive touchscreen
Sensors: NFC, gyroscope, accelerometer, geo-magnetic sensor
Audio: Stereo speakers and microphone
Other Features: Volume slider, game controls, IR sensor strip, headphone socket, stylus, rumble support, external expansion port
Our 32GB Premium Pack provides us with a Wii U console and GamePad in glossy black. The console itself is longer, a touch taller and more rounded at the edges than its predecessor, but still a small, compact, nicely designed little unit. Even compared to the new PlayStation 3 , Wii U feels diminutive in comparison and rather smart-looking. However, plastics on the main unit are hardly of a premium quality, attracting fingerprints and marking easily, and within two days of general us",

    description: "Tri Force Heroes is similar to the Four Swords games, in which Link is accompanied by two other Links poseas part of the game's Multiplayer. These Links are depicted as green, red, and blue. The game supports download play, local wireless, and online co-op gameplay.[19] During online co-op, players can select the option to play with friends or to be matched with random players from the internet.[20] The game also allows single-player gameplay, in which the other Links are replaced with Doppels that the player can switch between during gameplay,[21] similar to the single-player game in Four Swords Adventures.

The game is strongly based off of A Link Between Worlds aesthetics, including its graphics, enemies, and its use of platforms at different elevations. The Links can climb atop one another to form a Totem that allows them reach higher elevations. The Links must cooperate with each other and coordinate their attacks to solve puzzles, such as one Link throwing a Bomb while the other propels it away with the Gust Jar. On-screen notifications also appear to inform the other Links of one Link's current state or idea, such as suggesting to form a Totem. Several expressions can also be selected from the bottom screen, and can also be used to encourage the other Links or to express an idea or direction. Tapping on a Link's portrait on the touch screen will direct to their position, showing where they are.[22] The three Links share the same Heart Containers, lives (appearing as Fairies), and Rupees. As in A Link Between Worlds, there is also an Energy Gauge that depletes each time an item is used, and gradually recovers. Each Link has his own Energy
Green Link with two Doppels
The game features 32 Levels, with at least four Levels per area. The Levels themselves are structured and divided into four main sections each called Stages. A boss is usually fought at the last Stage, or a group of enemies in lieu of a boss. Each Level contains up to three different items that must be used to progress through them. At the end of each Stage is a Triforce-shaped portal that teleports the Links to another section.[22][23] Players can vote on which Level to go to from the Level selection screen while a timer ticks down. There are also Drablands Challenges, in which players play through more difficult versions of the Levels.[19]",

      description: "Crushing candies on the bottom is better than crushing candies at the top, because candies drop down, creating the potential for a cascade effect that essentially gives you free moves.
When getting rid of jellies, only worry about the edges, especially the corners and bottoms. These jellies have the least number of combinations which can eliminate them, so will be the hardest to get rid of. Take a moment each move to see if you can get rid edge jellies and, if not, go after an easier one.
The two best combinations are the wrapped candy and the stripped candy, and the sprinkle donut hole and the stripped candy.
If you want to boost your score, match four or five candies. Here are some tips. And some more tips from the developers.
Combine special candies for screen-clearing effects.
You only have a specific number of turns to complete a stage, which the game displays at the bottom of the screen, so keep that inmind. You must reach a certain number of points to beat a puzzle. But there is a way to get more turns.

    description: "Crime City is a free action and adventure game for Android smartphones.

You start out as an errand boy for big crime bosses in Crime City but soon take on the power of the big Mafia bosses, that is if you're skilled enough to advance.

By mugging people, killing off enemies and robbing shops, you get money and experience points. That's exactly what you need to buy better weapons and expand your empire of nefarious wrongdoing. The experience points ensure that you gradually advance to a higher level where you can unlock even more missions and tools.

If you've ever played Mafia Wars on Facebook, you'll recognize scenes in Crime City that are taken from Mafia Wars. The game is identical with one big difference: Mafia Wars can quickly become boring, whereas you get a lot more out of Crime City because there's more action. This makes it somewhat more entertaining to play, although Crime City too will at some point get a bit monotonous in terms of missions and crime bosses you encounter.

Crime City is basically an extended version of the hugely popular Mafia Wars with better graphics and action for your Android phone.
